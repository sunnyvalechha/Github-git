Git: Git is a version control system that is used to track changes in source code. Version controled can be done for anything like file, images, folder.

Repository in Git: The repositories of Github act as essential places for storing the files with maintaining the versions of development. By using GitHub repositories developers can organize, monitor, and save their changes of code to their projects in remote environments. 

Version control is of two types:
1. Centralized version control (CVCS)
2. Distributed version control system (DVCS)

CVCS: A central repository is a singular storage location for all data. There will be just one repository and that will contain all the history or version of the code and different branches of the code but if the repository had failed due to any issue so all the data will be lost.

DVCS: The only major difference you will find here is, instead of one single repository which is the server, here every single developer has their own server and they will have a copy of the entire history or version of the code and all of its branches in their local server or machine.

**Git is Distributed version control system**

Substitute of GitHub:
1. Gitlab
2. Bitbucket
3. Azure Devops
4. Aws cloud formation

If we put anything in git it will have following features.
1. Version (v1, v2)
2. Time
3. Author
4. Hash Id

Practical:

mkdir git-project
cd git-project/
mkdir project{1..3}
